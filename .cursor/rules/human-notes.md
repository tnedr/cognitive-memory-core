# Human Notes Rule

## Purpose

The `Z_HUMAN_NOTES.md` file is for **personal human notes only**. It serves as the human's private workspace for:
- Testing notes and observations
- Ideas and decisions
- Personal reminders and references

## AI Behavior

**NEVER write to `Z_HUMAN_NOTES.md` unless explicitly requested by the human.**

- The human fills it themselves
- AI only reads it when needed for context
- AI writes to it **ONLY** when human explicitly asks

## When Human Explicitly Requests

If human explicitly asks to write to `Z_HUMAN_NOTES.md`, be very brief:
- Maximum 2-3 sentences
- No formatting beyond basic markdown
- Just the essential information

## Example

❌ **BAD**: AI proactively writes notes about what was done
✅ **GOOD**: AI writes only when human says "add this to my notes" or "update Z_HUMAN_NOTES"
