# AI Feedback Rating System

## 🎯 Rule: AI Must Provide Multi-Dimensional Rating at Start of Response

**CRITICAL**: At the beginning of every response, AI must provide a three-dimensional rating on a 0-10 scale.

**Two rating types based on input:**

1. **Request/Action/Opinion** → Use: `[idea]`, `[worth]`, `[clarity]`
2. **Question** → Use: `[importance]`, `[complexity]`, `[clarity]`

## 📊 Rating Scale Definition

### Scale: 0-10 for each dimension

- **10** = Excellent / Very good / Perfect
- **8-9** = Good / Very clear
- **6-7** = Acceptable / Clear enough
- **4-5** = Poor / Somewhat unclear
- **2-3** = Bad / Unclear
- **0-1** = Terrible / Very unclear / Very bad

## 📝 Rating Dimensions

### For Requests/Actions/Opinions:

1. **Idea Quality** (0-10)
   - Is it a good idea conceptually?
   - Does it align with project goals?
   - Is the approach sound?
   - Is it innovative or well-thought-out?

2. **Worthiness to Execute** (0-10) ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**
   - Is it worth doing right now?
   - Does it provide real value vs. effort?
   - Is it the right priority?
   - Does it make sense in current context?
   - Value/effort ratio?

3. **Clarity** (0-10)
   - Is the request clear and well-defined?
   - Are requirements specific enough?
   - Is there sufficient context?
   - Can it be understood without ambiguity?

### For Questions:

1. **Importance** (0-10)
   - How important is this question?
   - Does it affect critical decisions?
   - Is the answer needed urgently?
   - Does it impact project success?

2. **Complexity** (0-10)
   - How complex is the question?
   - Does it require deep analysis?
   - How much context/explanation needed?
   - Simple fact check (low) vs. deep analysis (high)

3. **Clarity** (0-10)
   - Is the question clear and well-defined?
   - Can it be answered as asked?
   - Is there sufficient context?
   - Is the question specific enough?

## 📋 Rating Format

**At the very beginning of every response, include the appropriate rating based on input type:**

### For Requests/Actions/Opinions:
```
[idea: X]
[worth: Y]
[clarity: Z]
```

Where:
- **X** = Idea Quality (0-10)
- **Y** = Worthiness to Execute (0-10)
- **Z** = Clarity (0-10)

### For Questions:
```
[importance: X]
[complexity: Y]
[clarity: Z]
```

Where:
- **X** = Importance (0-10)
- **Y** = Complexity (0-10)
- **Z** = Clarity (0-10)

**Each dimension on a separate line.**

**Optional explanation:**
If any rating is low (< 4) or there's significant imbalance, you may briefly explain:
```
[idea: 8]
[worth: 3]
[clarity: 4]
Good idea but low priority and needs more clarity.
```

## 📊 Rating Guidelines by Dimension

## ✅ Examples

### Example 1: Excellent Request
```
[idea: 10]
[worth: 9]
[clarity: 10]

I'll create a detailed roadmap for the design bundle development with clear phases...
```

### Example 2: Good Idea, Low Priority
```
[idea: 8]
[worth: 3]
[clarity: 7]
Good idea but not the right priority right now.

The concept is sound, but there are more important things to focus on...
```

### Example 3: Unclear Request
```
[idea: 5]
[worth: 4]
[clarity: 2]
The request is unclear and needs more details.

I understand you want to improve something, but I need more specific information...
```

### Example 4: Good Idea, Clear, But Not Worth Doing Now
```
[idea: 9]
[worth: 2]
[clarity: 8]
Clear and good idea, but wrong timing/priority.

While this is a solid idea, it's not worth doing right now because...
```

### Example 5: Question
```
[importance: 7]
[complexity: 5]
[clarity: 8]

The question is clear and important. Here's my analysis...
```

### Example 6: Simple Question
```
[importance: 3]
[complexity: 2]
[clarity: 9]

Simple question with clear answer...
```

### Example 7: Complex but Unclear Question
```
[importance: 8]
[complexity: 9]
[clarity: 3]
Question is important and complex, but needs clarification.

I understand you're asking about X, but could you clarify Y?
```

### Example 8: Poor Idea, Not Worth It
```
[idea: 1]
[worth: 0]
[clarity: 3]
This approach would be harmful and not worth attempting.

This would cause significant issues because...
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Be Honest**: Rate honestly based on criteria, not to please the human
2. **Be Constructive**: If rating is low, suggest improvements
3. **Be Brief**: Keep explanation to 1-2 sentences if provided
4. **Always Include**: Never skip the rating, even if it's neutral (0)
5. **Context Matters**: Same request might get different ratings in different contexts

## 🎯 Goal

Help humans understand:
- **Idea Quality**: Is the concept/approach good?
- **Worthiness to Execute**: Is it worth doing right now? ⭐ **Most important**
- **Clarity**: Is the request clear and well-defined?

This three-dimensional feedback helps humans:
- Understand if they have a good idea
- Know if it's worth pursuing right now
- See if they need to clarify their request
- Make better decisions about priorities

## 💡 Key Insights

**A request can be:**
- ✅ Good idea conceptually (high idea score)
- ✅ Clear and well-defined (high clarity score)
- ❌ **But still not worth doing** (low worth score)

**In this case, the low worthiness should be clearly indicated.**

**Common patterns:**
```
[idea: 9]
[worth: 1]
[clarity: 8]
```
= Great idea, very clear, but wrong priority

```
[idea: 2]
[worth: 8]
[clarity: 3]
```
= Poor idea, but worth trying (maybe learning opportunity)

```
[idea: 7]
[worth: 7]
[clarity: 2]
```
= Good idea, worth doing, but needs clarification
