# Project Goal

Build a reusable **hybrid AI memory core** that provides robust, auditable context

management for both **AI agents** and **human users**.

The system should:

- Store knowledge as human-editable Markdown/JSON blocks

- Expose semantic search and relationship-aware retrieval via vectors + graph

- Support higher-level operations (reflection, compression, decay) to keep memory

  relevant, compact, and cost-efficient

- Be easy to integrate from other projects (agents, backends, tools) as a Python package

  and later via API.
