# Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search

Vector embeddings convert text into numerical representations that capture semantic meaning. This enables similarity search - finding documents or concepts that are semantically similar, even if they don't share exact keywords.

## How It Works

1. **Encoding**: Text is converted to dense vectors using models like:
   - Sentence Transformers
   - OpenAI embeddings
   - BERT-based models

2. **Storage**: Vectors are stored in specialized databases:
   - ChromaDB
   - FAISS
   - Pinecone
   - Weaviate

3. **Search**: Similarity is calculated using:
   - Cosine similarity
   - Euclidean distance
   - Dot product

## Advantages

- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds conceptually similar content
- **Language Agnostic**: Works across different languages
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles typos and variations
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large datasets

## Applications

- Document retrieval
- Recommendation systems
- Question answering
- Knowledge base search
- AI memory systems
