# Graph Databases and Neo4j

Graph databases are designed to store and query relationships between entities efficiently. Unlike relational databases that use tables, graph databases use nodes and edges to represent data and connections.

## Neo4j Overview

Neo4j is a popular graph database that uses:
- **Nodes**: Represent entities (people, places, concepts)
- **Relationships**: Represent connections between nodes
- **Properties**: Key-value pairs on nodes and relationships
- **Cypher**: Declarative query language

## Key Advantages

1. **Relationship Queries**: Fast traversal of connections
2. **Flexible Schema**: Easy to add new node types and relationships
3. **Pattern Matching**: Powerful query capabilities
4. **ACID Transactions**: Data consistency guarantees

## Use Cases

- Social networks and recommendations
- Knowledge graphs
- Fraud detection
- Network analysis
- AI memory systems

## Example Query

```cypher
MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(b:Person)
WHERE a.name = 'Alice'
RETURN b.name
```
