# Memory Systems in AI Agents

Memory systems are crucial for AI agents to maintain context, learn from past interactions, and make informed decisions. They enable agents to remember previous conversations, store learned patterns, and retrieve relevant information when needed.

## Components

A comprehensive memory system typically includes:

1. **Short-term Memory**: Recent context and immediate state
2. **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learned patterns
3. **Working Memory**: Active information being processed
4. **Episodic Memory**: Specific events and experiences

## Hybrid Architecture

Modern memory systems often combine:
- **File Storage**: Human-readable knowledge blocks (Markdown/JSON)
- **Graph Database**: Relationship tracking (Neo4j)
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity (ChromaDB/FAISS)

## Benefits

- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history
- **Learning**: Accumulate knowledge over time
- **Efficiency**: Fast retrieval of relevant information
- **Scalability**: Handle large knowledge bases
